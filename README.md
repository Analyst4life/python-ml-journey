# Python & Machine Learning Journey

This Git repository documents my journey in Python programming and Machine Learning. I started out self-teaching myself to code, then decided to pursue a Master’s in Information Technology (MSIT) to deepen my technical knowledge. While working through MSIT, I also applied for a coding academy program, which will equip me with the skills expected of a junior software engineer. Even if I don’t end up working as a software engineer, data scientist, or Machine Learning engineer, having coding skills will still be highly valuable.

Before starting the Machine Learning course with the University of the People, I completed a beginner-level Machine Learning course through Coursera, which helped me build foundational knowledge in the subject. In addition to the MSIT program, the coding academy, and Coursera course, I continue to practice coding through Coddy.Tech. I decided to collect my coding practices in this repository as a way to track and showcase my learning. It contains Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, datasets, and other supporting files from coursework, personal projects, and experiments. The notebooks and scripts will evolve from beginner-level exercises with detailed comments to more intermediate and advanced projects as my skills develop.

## Purpose
- Practice Python programming and machine learning concepts with a forward-looking approach.  
- Document learning, including comments and explanations where helpful for future reference.  
- Track progress through coursework, personal projects, and future coding experiments.  
- Apply skills and knowledge gained from work projects to personal and coursework projects.

## Contents
- Python exercises and projects  
- Machine Learning examples  
- Datasets and supporting files  
- Notes and explanations in beginner notebooks for clarity

## Future Plans
- Continuously add new notebooks, scripts, and datasets from ongoing coursework.  
- Develop intermediate and advanced projects over time.  
- Apply skills learned from personal, coursework, and professional experiences to new coding challenges.

## Tools
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Anaconda distribution**  
- **Scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**

This repository serves as a dynamic portfolio of hands-on coding practice and learning, reflecting growth over time and the ability to tackle increasingly complex projects in Python and Machine Learning.
